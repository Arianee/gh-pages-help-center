# üí° Minimalistic Help Center hosted on GitHub Pages

This is a minimalistic responsive Help Center that is entirely hosted on GitHub pages. It
does not need the maintenance of any servers or databases and can be hosted
entirely on ‚ù§Ô∏è GitHub for free!

Includes a few simple dependencies like [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) for better fuzzy search and [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) to convert
markdown to html.

Inspired by [Githu Pages URL shortener](https://github.com/nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener/)
