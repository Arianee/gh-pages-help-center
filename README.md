# üí° Minimalistic Help Center hosted on GitHub Pages

This is a minimalistic responsive Help Center hosted on GitHub pages. It does not need the maintenance of any servers or databases and can be hosted entirely on ‚ù§Ô∏è GitHub for free!

Includes a very few dependencies:

-   [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) for better fuzzy search
-   [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) to convert
    markdown to HTML
-   Beatiful font [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter)

Feel free to customize by visual identity of your preference .)
To update `<head>` of your Help Center is recommended to follow [HEAD - A list of everything that _could_ go in the head of your document ](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD)

Inspired by [Githu Pages URL shortener](https://github.com/nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener/).
